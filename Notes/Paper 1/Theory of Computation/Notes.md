# Computational Theory


## Problem solving

**Proposition:** A statement that can resolve to a boolean,
e.g. *"Today is Friday"*.

**Compound Proposition:** Multiple propositions joined by an operator,
e.g. *"It snows only if it is cold."*

**Conditional Connective:** If P is only true when Q is true, then P => Q.

**Fundamental Principle of Logical Reasoning:** P => Q, Q => R âŠ¢ P => R

**Newton's Principle:** *"Whatever is true of everything before our eyes is true of everything in the universe,"*
e.g. *"If x is a footballer, then x wears football boots when playing football."*


## Following and writing algorithms

**Algorithm:** A precise set of instructions used to solve a problem.

Algorithms can be difficult design because:
- They must be unambiguous
- They must achieve the same result
- They must work correctly for all possible inputs / problem instances 
- They must finish in a finite time
- There may be more problem instances than is possible to test for

*"The following are sufficient for constructing algorithms:"*
- sequence
- assignment
- selection
- iteration

Pseudo-code is often used to express a problem,
as it is unambiguous and does not rely on a 
specific language's syntax.

**Correctness:** Whether a program will give 
the correct output for any possible input.
