(a) If the wind blows from the north, then it snows.
<br>
(b) If not exercising enough, then get unfit.
<br>
(c) If it is autumn, then the leaves on the trees turn brown.
<br>
(d) `if (temperature=100) water.boil();`
<br>
(e) If the goods were bought within the last 2 weeks, a refund can be obtained.

- Major proposition: *If it is cold, he wears a hat*
- Minor proposition: *It is cold*
- **Conclusion:** *He wears a hat*

3\) No; he could wear a hat when it isn't cold.

4\) Taxes will be lowered.

5\) No; the politician could have lowered taxes without having been elected.

6\) No.

7\) Both Alice and Ben must be telling the truth.

10\) The initial proposition is wrong.

11\) Yes.

12\) Yes.

13\) *"If it snows today, I can catch up on my homework."*

14\) *If the train arrives early, Jamin can call in on his friend John.*

15\) *"If I don't watch the late night film, I will wake up feeling refreshed."*

16\) *If Alex is allowed a TV in his bedroom, he will neglect his homework.*

17\) *There were taxis at the airport.*

18\) *Isla had her raincoat with her.*

19\) U and 3. 
If U has an odd number on the other side, 
or 3 has a vowel on the other side, 
then the rule is false.

20\)  P(3) == false, P(7) == true

21\) *Gerry drinks coffee.*

22\) *Deemei has learned at least one programming language.*

23\) Both of them must be lying.




## Following and Writing Algorithms

#### Page 365

1\) There are an infinite number of possible outcomes.


#### Page 367

1\) `Product <- Product + y`; `NoOfTimes <- NoOfTimes + 1`

2\) `Power <- Power * x`; `Count <- Count + 1`

3\)
```
Input: N    [Integer > 0]

Algorithm:
    Count <- 0
    While 2^(Count+1)
        Count <- Count + 1
    EndWhile

Output: m, where 2^m < N and 2^(m+1) > N 
```

4\)
```
Input: n    [Integer > 0]

Algorithm:
    Total <- 0
    Count <- 1
    While Count <= n
        Total <- Total + Count
        Count <- Count + 1
    EndWhile

Output: Sum of the first n natural numbers 
```

5\)
```
Input: n    [Integer > 0]

Algorithm:
    Total <- 1
    Count <- 1
    While Count <= n
        Total <- Total * Count
        Count <- Count + 1
    EndWhile

Output: Product of the first n natural numbers 
```
