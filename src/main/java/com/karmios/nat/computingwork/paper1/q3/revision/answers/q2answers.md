**(c)** The loop is iterated through a set number of times (in this case, whichever number the user inputs).

**(d)** A string, such as `"hello"`, could crash the program. A solution could be to wrap the input in a try/catch block,

**(e)**
- Functions / subprocedures
- Object-Oriented structures such as classes and interfaces
- Syntax formatting, such as Java's braces (`{}`)

**(f)**
- `aaab` - accepted
- `abbab` - *not* accepted
- `bbbbba` - accepted

**(g)** Strings that contain only `b`s and an odd number of `a`s
